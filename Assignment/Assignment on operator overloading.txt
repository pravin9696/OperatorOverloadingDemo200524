operator overloading

  public static return_type operator op(type t)
     {
         //statements
     }

here type is class or structure


methodv overloading Vs method overriding

-method overloading
    - method name same but different parameters
    - method overloading can be done in same class or in inheritance


-method overriding

  - method name and parameters must be same
   - can be done in inheritance only(ie parent class and child class only)
   - add keyword virtual before parent class method
   - add keyword override before child class method 


example of method overloading

   class calculator
      {
        public void sum(int x,int y)
             {
             
             }
        public void sum(int a,int b,int c)
             {
              
             }
      }

method overriding example

class shape
    {
       virtual public void Calculate_Area()
           {
            
           }
    }
 
  class circle:shape
      {
        override public void Caculate_Area()
            {
         
            }
      }



reference variable of parent class= object of child class 






Assignment on Operator Overloding

1) write a class employee with some instance variables like emp_id, name, salary and dept.
   overload following operators for given purpose

     i) overload == operator to check two employees having same salary or not
     ii) overload true / false operator to check employee having salary greater than 25000 or not
     iii) overload + operator to add salary of two employees and store into thrid employees salary

2) write a class circle with appropriate instance variable. overload following operators for different purpose as given below
		i) overload == operator to compare two circle objects are equals or not
		ii) overload ++ operator to increment radius of circle then calculate area of circle
